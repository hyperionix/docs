# Events
Events are object generated by [probe](probe-details) and look like named list of attributes. Events can be monitored and analyzed with Hyperionix Entity State Machine and saved to EventChannel. Events can also include one or multiple [entities](entities). Events are created in probe callbacks using function `Event`:
```lua
  local event = Event(
    -- event name
    "My Event",
    -- list of event attributes
    {
      foo = 1,
      bar = "2"
    }
  )
```

## EventChannel
EventChannel is a place where an event will be sent. Used as parameter of method `send` of event object. This is the part of [hp](api#hplib) library. Currently the following event channels are supported:
* `file`  - save event to events log file stored in Hyperionix installation directory;
* `splunk` - save event to configured Splunk (https://www.splunk.com/) server;
* `console` - dump event to console (use it only in local development with HDK);
* `hpsvc` - send event to Hyperionix Service (enabled by default);
* `esm` - send event to ESM in Hyperionix Service (enabled by default).
```lua
  local EventChannel = hp.EventChannel
  -- ...
  -- Send event to file and splunk channels. 
  event1:send(EventChannel.file, EventChannel.splunk)
  -- ..
  -- Send event to file channel and don't send to ESM channel
  event2:send(EventChannel.file, -EventChannel.esm)
```
You can disable any channel for debugging or even forever prepending minus `-` to the channel.
> NOTE: Disabling `esm` and `hpsvc` channels isn't typical and you don't need to do it in most cases.
